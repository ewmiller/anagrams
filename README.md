Anagrams project for CS 311. Developed by Ethan Miller.

The goal of this program is to find all anagrams in a dictionary. Given a text
file consisting of lowercase words, this program computes all anagram "classes"
that occur in the dictionary. For example, the words "tops", "opts", and "pots"
are all in the same anagram class.
